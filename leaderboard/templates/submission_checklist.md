## 5. Technical Verification

### 5.1 PLY File Validation
```bash
# Run this command to validate your PLY file
python scripts/evaluate_submission.py --ply_path ./output/model.ply --student_id YOUR_ID
```
- [ ] Validation passes without errors

- [ ] File metadata is correct

### 5.2 Local Evaluation
```bash
# Run full local evaluation
python scripts/evaluate_submission.py \
    --ply_path ./output/model.ply \
    --training_log ./logs/training.log \
    --student_id YOUR_ID \
    --output ./my_evaluation.json
```
- [ ] Evaluation completes successfully
- [ ] Score is as expected
- [ ] No warnings or errors

### 5.3 File Size Check
```bash
# Check total submission size
du -sh submission/
```
- [ ] Total size < 500 MB (excluding large PLY files)
- [ ] Individual files within limits

---

## 6. Final Verification

### 6.1 Naming Convention
- [ ] All files follow naming convention: `{student_id}_{description}.{ext}`
- [ ] No spaces in filenames
- [ ] Consistent use of underscores

### 6.2 Directory Structure
```

```

### 6.3 Submission Package
- [ ] Create compressed archive: `{student_id}_submission.zip`
- [ ] Verify archive extracts correctly
- [ ] All paths are relative (no absolute paths)

---

## 7. Common Issues to Avoid

### ❌ Don't
- Submit corrupted or incomplete PLY files
- Include the entire OpenSplat repository
- Use absolute file paths
- Submit without testing locally
- Exceed page limits in report
- Forget to include training log
- Leave placeholder text in metadata

### ✅ Do
- Test PLY file in a viewer before submission
- Include only modified source files
- Use relative paths throughout
- Run local evaluation before submitting
- Proofread your report
- Double-check all numerical values
- Fill in all metadata fields accurately

---

## 8. Submission Deadline

**Deadline**: [INSERT DATE AND TIME]

- [ ] Submitted before deadline
- [ ] Received confirmation email
- [ ] Backup copy saved locally

---

## 9. Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the FAQ in the leaderboard documentation
2. Post on the course discussion forum
3. Contact TAs during office hours
4. Email course staff (allow 24-48 hours for response)
